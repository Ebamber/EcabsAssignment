The SQL scripts included in the project will help you get started with the tables that you need.
    (bookings.sql, audits.sql, waypoints.sql)

Change the DB credentials to those of whatever DB server you will be using.
For development I am using a localhost SQL server with placeholder values.

If you must change the names of any of the tables, the changes in names must also be 
reflected in application.yml and application-test.yml
